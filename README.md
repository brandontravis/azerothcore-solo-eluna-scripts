# AzerothCore Solo Server - Eluna Lua Scripts

A comprehensive collection of custom Eluna Lua scripts designed for a solo World of Warcraft WotLK server experience. This project focuses on creating engaging solo gameplay while maintaining the authentic progression and challenge of the original WoW experience.

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains custom Eluna Lua scripts that enhance the solo player experience on an AzerothCore server. The scripts are designed to work with several key mods that create a balanced, challenging, and enjoyable solo experience:

### Core Mods Integration
- **mod-individual-progression**: Gates content to match original WoW release progression
- **mod-autobalance**: Scales encounters for solo play while maintaining challenge
- **mod-playerbots**: Provides AI companions when needed
- **mod-ah-bot**: Maintains a functional auction house economy
- **mod-solo-craft**: Enables solo crafting of items that normally require groups

### Design Philosophy
- **Authentic Experience**: Content is gated to match original WoW release progression
- **Solo-Focused**: All systems are designed for single-player enjoyment
- **Challenging**: Maintains difficulty while being accessible to solo players
- **Progressive**: Systems that scale with player progression and gear
